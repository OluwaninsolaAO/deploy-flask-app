# Deploy Flask Application with Gunicorn

In this repository, I am following a guide to deploying a Flask
Application with Gunicorn.

In this guide, we will be setting up a simple Python application
using the Flask micro-framework on Ubuntu 16.04. The bulk of this
article will be about how to set up the Gunicorn application server
to launch the application and Nginx to act as a front end reverse proxy.
